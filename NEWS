** Several minor indentation bugs have been fixed.

** Added "2.2 Upgrading from previous versions" to the user guide.

** ada-align now properly handles subprograms with the opening paren
   on the same line as the preceding code and code on the same line as
   the closing paren:

    function Foo (Param_1 : Integer;
                  Param_2 : Integer) return Integer;

** When no project file is selected, the default variables are
   consistently used instead. Previously, the default variables were
   only used when parsing a project file.

** info files are properly visible in main info menu

** 'C-c ;' used to run `comment-dim', which is bound to 'M-;' in the
   global keymap. 'C-c ;' now gives an error with a message saying
   'use M-; instead'.
